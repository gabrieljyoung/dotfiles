Custom implementation of [Colemak Mod-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) for ANSI keyboards, which retains Z as the leftmost key of the lower row.

Included in this repository are `evdev.{lst,xml}`, which are actually complete lists of keyboard layouts (from whichever instance of `xdg` I was running at the time) with my custom `ck` layout added, for simplicity. As such, copying these lists into an `xdg` installation may remove some previously available keyboard layouts.
